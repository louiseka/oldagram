# Oldagram

## Description 

### What is Oldagram

Oldagram is a recreation of 'Instagram', but used by historical figures. 

### Technologies used

I have used JavaScript for this project, because:

- I can utilise a dataset by writing less code. 
- Creates a dynamic app where more data can be added and used. 

## Future implementations

- Create the functionality to like and unlike posts
- Create the functionality to leave comments on posts
- Save likes and comments the user has made to local storage
